Boids Game created for IMGD 4000
By Bright Lin

The game is created in a 3D space but you will be looking downwards into a samll space where the enemies will be creating the boids behavior. 

Rules:
Try to survive by dodging the red enemies. You will only lose if you get caught and get carried by the enemies. Meaning there are ways to collide with the enemies but still coninue on, ways such are going in the same directon of the enemy coming towards you thus stopping you from getting carried. There are other ways but you'll have to play the game to find them out. You could even ride an enemy out of the map if you're skilled enough. If you get carried by the enemy the game will reset and you will be spawned in the middle of the map and the enemies will respawn also. 

Controls:
WASD

Excuse me if the quality is a bit bad. I am on my laptop and I am not able to run Unreal as smoothly as I want to on it so the game was having really low frames. If you think I need to resubmit the video I will try to find a computer to rerecord it. Thank you!
